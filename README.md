Phishing is a type of cyber attack where someone impersonates a
legitimate website page in order to collect sensitive information from
the victim and use it maliciously. To combat the risks associated
with this threat, it is important to identify phishing sites in time.
Machine learning models work well for this purpose since they can
predict phishing incidents using basic information about the sites. In
most of the most modern solutions dealing with phishing detection,
several techniques for identifying phishing have been proposed, such
as third-party and heuristic approaches. These approaches suffer from
a number of limitations that need to be addressed in order to identify
phishing addresses. Therefore, this project will discuss our contribution
to the identification of phishing sites by proposing a machine learning
model that identifies phishing URL addresses using lexically based
features, which do not rely on any third-party services and do not
require visiting the web page for feature extraction.

____


In this study, a machine learning model for identifying phishing URL addresses was presented, based on a dataset containing both malicious and
non-malicious URLs. Various features based on the entire URL address as
well as from the full domain name, path name, file name, and parameters
were introduced. These features do not rely on any third-party services and
do not require visiting the web page for feature extraction. The feature extraction uses the Random Forest technique. The selected features will enable
us to train our machine learning model to classify each website address in
the best way possible.
